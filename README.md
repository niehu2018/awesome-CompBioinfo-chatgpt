## Quick Prompts

The following prompts may not be the most efficient in terms of prompt engineering, but they are quick, useful and exemplify usage of ChatGPT for computational biologists. 

###  Improve Code Readability and Documentation

* “Add explanatory comments to this code: {code here}”
* “Rename the variables for clarity: {code here}” 
* "Render roxygen2 documentation for the function: {R code here}”.

### Write Code Efficiently

* "Extract functions to increase modularity: {code here}"
* "Write a unit test for the following function and help me implement it: {code here}"
* "Re-write and optimize this for loop: {code here}"

### Clean up data

* "Write me regex for R/python/Excel with a pattern that will extract {} from {}"
* "Act as a table. Add a new column with consistent labels to this dataset:"


### Improve data visualization

* "Create a ggplot2 violin plot with a log10 Y axis"
* "Change my code to make the plot color-blind friendly"
* "Translate this plot from ggplot2 to matplotlib syntax"
