**User**:
Can you provide a version of this function in Rust and explain very concisely why it is more efficient computationally?
```
def reverse_complement(sequence):
    complement = {'A': 'T', 'T': 'A', 'C': 'G', 'G': 'C'}
    reverse_complement = ''

    for nucleotide in sequence[::-1]:
        reverse_complement += complement[nucleotide]

    return reverse_complement
```

**ChatGPT**:
Certainly! Here's a version of the reverse_complement function in Rust:

```
fn reverse_complement(sequence: &str) -> String {
    let complement: Vec<char> = vec!['T', 'A', 'G', 'C'];
    let mut reverse_complement = String::new();

    for nucleotide in sequence.chars().rev() {
        match nucleotide {
            'A' => reverse_complement.push(complement[0]),
            'T' => reverse_complement.push(complement[1]),
            'C' => reverse_complement.push(complement[2]),
            'G' => reverse_complement.push(complement[3]),
            _ => (),
        }
    }

    reverse_complement
}
```
Now, let's discuss why this Rust implementation can be more efficient computationally compared to the original Python code:

- **Data Structure**: In Rust, we use a Vec<char> to represent the complement rather than a dictionary. Using a vector allows for constant-time indexing, whereas dictionary lookups in Python have a time complexity of O(1) on average but can be slower in practice due to hashing.
- **String Concatenation**: Instead of concatenating strings directly in the loop, we utilize a mutable String and push each complement character individually. This avoids unnecessary string copying and reallocation, resulting in better performance.
- **Reverse Iteration**: The Rust implementation uses the chars().rev() method to iterate over the sequence in reverse order. This eliminates the need to create a reversed copy of the sequence explicitly, as done with sequence[::-1] in Python.

Overall, these optimizations help improve the efficiency of the Rust implementation by reducing memory allocations, eliminating dictionary lookups, and avoiding unnecessary string operations, resulting in faster execution.
